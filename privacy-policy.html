      <h1>Privacy policy</h1> 
      <p>As operator of this website we take the protection of your personal data very seriously. That is why we apply the principle of data minimization and process personal data only when it is necessary. If we process data, you can be sure that we only use it for the indicated purpose and do not disclose it to third parties. The following privacy policy explains how we process your personal data when you use our website.</p> 
      <h2>Controller</h2> 
      <p>The controller for the processing of any kind of personal data on this website is Sebastian KÃ¼rten, reachable via email at sebastian@topobyte.de.</p> 
      <h2>Server logs</h2> 
      <p>When you visit any web page of this website, some personal data is inevitably transmitted from your web browser to our web server. On the one hand, our server gets to know the IP address of your device since it is required to establish a connection. On the other hand, your web browser usually sends different pieces of information along with each request. This particularly includes the time of the request, as well as the so-called referer, i.e. the address of the web page you visited in the same browser window or tab before navigating to the current page, and also the so-called user agent, a short string that includes your operating system, browser name and version number.</p> 
      <p>This information is stored on our servers for a period of two weeks in the so-called server logs and is deleted afterwards. We do this to ensure the proper operation of our website and to get some statistical insight into which part of the website gets visited how often.</p> 
      <p>The legal basis for this processing is point (f) of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The data is not transmitted to any third party. We are not able to identify which person this data belongs to. Because of that, we are neither able to provide information about which data is stored about you in our server logs nor to ensure data portability. If you inform us about your IP address, we will gladly delete all data stored in connection to that address within our server logs upon your request.</p> 
      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation grants you the right to object to processing of your personal data. However, the web server software we are using cannot be configured to ignore certain IP addresses for the purpose of server logs. Nevertheless, if you are concerned about the data you reveal by browsing websites, you can effectively avoid transmitting such information by configuring your browser accordingly or by using an appropriate plugin. Especially for data like referer and user agent, there are browser extensions available that block or alter this kind of information.</p> 
      <h2>Other common forms of data processing</h2> 
      <p>Except for what is mentioned above, we do not process any personal data. In particular we intentionally do not use cookies and do not use any tools for analyzing your behavior on this website.</p> 
      <h2>Your right to lodge a complaint</h2> 
      <p>If you think your rights are being infringed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.</p>
